## Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IsaiahByrd/cmsc433-pokemon-game.git
cd cmsc433-pokemon-game
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

python -m venv venv
```

- On Windows, activate with:
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```
- On Mac/Linux, activate with:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

You should now see (venv) in your terminal prompt.

### 3. Install Dependencies
Make sure you're in the project root (same level as requirements.txt), then run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you don't have a requirements.txt yet, generate it with:
```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the Flask Server

```bash
python app.py
```

You should see output like:
